# This is broken.

This is a hastily archived version of my adventures in Terraform, documented for my own prosperity and made public incase it assists those in search of answers.

It is not good code, nor does it build a complete product. It also does not conform to best practice. It also doesn't even work.

It's largely broken because I've tried to censor a lot, but I know there are references left in. Will eventually make this all work beautifully however for now, it is how it is with zero explanation why there are three s3 buckets and no rds.
